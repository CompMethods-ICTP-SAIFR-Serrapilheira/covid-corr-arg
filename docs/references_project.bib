	abstract = {The ability to accurately forecast the number of COVID-19 cases and future case trends would certainly assist governments and various organisations in strategising and preparing for the newly infected cases well in advance. Many predictions have failed to foresee future COVID-19 cases due to the lack of reliable data; however, such data are now widely available for predicting future trends in COVID-19 after more than one and a half years of the pandemic. Also, various countries are closely monitoring other countries that are experiencing a surge in COVID-19 cases in the expectation of similar scenarios, but this does not always produce correct results, as no research has identified specific correlations between different countries in terms of COVID-19 cases. During the past 18 months, many nations have watched countries whose COVID-19 cases have risen sharply, in anticipation of handling the situation themselves. However, this did not provide accurate results, as no research was conducted that compared countries to determine if their COVID-19 case trends were correlated. As official data on COVID-19 cases has become increasingly available, using the Pearson correlation technique to pinpoint the countries that should be closely monitored will help governments plan and prepare for the number of infections that are expected in the future at an early stage. In this study, a simple and real-time prediction of COVID-19 cases incorporating existing variables of coronavirus variants was used to explore the correlation among different European countries in terms of the number of COVID-19 cases officially recorded on a daily basis. Data from selected countries over the past 76 weeks were analysed using a Pearson correlation technique to determine if there were correlations between case trends and geographical position. The correlation coefficient (r) was employed for identifying whether the different countries in Europe were interrelated, with r {\textgreater} 0.85 indicating they were very strongly correlated, 0.85 {\textgreater} r {\textgreater} 0.8 indicating that they were strongly correlated, 0.8 {\textgreater} r {\textgreater} 0.7 indicating that they were moderately correlated, and r {\textless} 0.7 indicating that the examined countries were either weakly correlated or that a correlation did not exist. The results showed that although some neighbouring countries are strongly correlated, other countries that are not geographically close are also correlated. In addition, some countries on opposite sides of Europe (Belgium and Armenia) are also correlated. Other countries (France, Iceland, Israel, Kosovo, San Marino, Spain, Sweden and Turkey) were either weakly correlated or had no relationship at all.},

	abstract = {The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has followed complex pathways, largely attributed to the high virus infectivity, human travel patterns, and the implementation of multiple mitigation measures. The resulting geographic patterns describe the evolution of the epidemic and can indicate areas that are at risk of an outbreak. Here, we analyze the spatial correlations of new active cases in the USA at the county level and characterize the extent of these correlations at different times. We show that the epidemic did not progress uniformly and we identify various stages which are distinguished by significant differences in the correlation length. Our results indicate that the correlation length may be large even during periods when the number of cases declines. We find that correlations between urban centers were much more significant than between rural areas and this finding indicates that long-range spreading was mainly facilitated by travel between cities, especially at the first months of the epidemic. We also show the existence of a percolation transition in November 2020, when the largest part of the country was connected to a spanning cluster, and a smaller-scale transition in January 2021, with both times corresponding to the peak of the epidemic in the country.},

	abstract = {As the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on public health and global economies in 2020; it is crucial to understand how it developed and spread in time and space. This paper contributes to the growing literature by considering the dynamics of country-wise growth rates of infection numbers. Low-order serial correlation of growth rates is predominantly negative with cycles of two to four days for most countries. The results of fitted spatial autoregressive models suggest that there is high degree of spillover between countries. Forecast variances of many countries, in particular those with a high absolute number of infections, can to a large extent be explained by structural innovations of other countries. A better understanding of the serial and spatial dynamics of the spread of the pandemic may contribute to an improved containment and risk management.},
